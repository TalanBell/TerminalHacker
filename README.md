# TerminalHacker
From Complete C# Unity Developer 3D 

A program to simulate an old (1980's) terminal being used to hack into various systems. Passwords are  based on themes, increasing in length and difficulty. Clues will be given as anagrams of passwords.

# Changes: 
(where v relates to Udemy course video number)
* v24 Refactoring, and first big challenge (going solo)
* v25 Arrays of variables - used for storing passwords (and devices)
* v26 switch vs if - replacing levels with switch rather than if (when in Screen.Password)
* v27 Introducing Random behaviour - randomly choosing a password from the correct level array
* v28 Creating a Win Screen - using ASCII art to make it look nice, using @" to send verbatim to screen
* v29 Integration Challenge - adding anagram hint, tidying up, adding const for menu propmt
* v31 Restoring from github after program stopped working (trying to change names for publishing). Also, adding a Wargames Easter Egg. One last Easter Egg, plus a list of Easter Eggs available.
